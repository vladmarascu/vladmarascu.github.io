<h2> <b> <i class="fa fa-info-circle"></i>&nbsp;About me: </b></h2>
<p> I am a detail-oriented Third-Year Aeronautical Engineering student at Imperial College London, with an expected First Class Honours degree. I am interested in all areas of computing and engineering but my main focus lies on Simulations Engineering (Computational Fluid Dynamics and High-Performance Computing) and software engineering, as well as the big data sector. I am a flexible person in the tech field, with extensive knowledge of multiple programming languages and database administration tools such as C++, Python, Matlab and SQL. All this said, I am always eager to improve both my personal and professional attributes while working in the vast and ever-growing engineering industry.
Apart from my academic interests, I currently practice tennis at a high level and take great pleasure in reading ancient or modern history books that describe past civilizations. </p>

<h4><b> Undergraduate Research Internship </b> </h4>
<b>Company: </b> Incompact3d Software <br>
<b>Duration: </b> July 2019 - September 2019 <br>
<b>Location: </b> London, United Kingdom
<p>
-&nbsp; Awarded with the EPSRC bursary  <br>
-&nbsp; Designed and programmed a graphical user interface, a database and post-processing tools for the computational fluid dynamics software <a href="https://www.incompact3d.com/" target="_blank" >www.Incompact3d.com</a>, an open-source Linux & Fortran based high-order flow solver <br> 
-&nbsp; Highly consolidated and exercised my Python, Linux and SQL programming knowledge, with the aim of creating a friendly interface that made Incompact3d more accessible for users with little experience in simulations <br> 
-&nbsp; Encountered and solved a multitude of interdisciplinary problems that related both to Python and SQL, but also to the CFD software, providing me with a chance to get accustomed with this cutting-edge field of computing<br> 
-&nbsp; Worked closely with Dr Sylvain Laizet and his team of researchers, thus enhancing my teamwork abilities<br>

<p>
-&nbsp; Part of the Aeronautical Department&#39;s team of students focused on designing and building functional rockets to compete in the Spaceport America Cup 2020, the world&#39;s largest intercollegiate rocket engineering competition <br>
-&nbsp; As the leader of the Simulations subgroup, I am responsible in developing and overseeing all the pieces of code that encompass the rockets&#39; flight parameters, such as altitude, thrust, fuel decay and weight distribution, while also aiding the other subgroups with their required programming, predominantly working in C++/Matlab/Python <br> 
-&nbsp; Perfected my coding, teamwork and problem-solving abilities while working in an engineering-related environment which provided me with a valuable insight into the real-world computing-related spacecraft industry

<p>I have played tennis competitively for the past 10 years and I am now currently part of the Imperial College Tennis Team. I pratice tennis regularly: 3 times/ week, participating in tournaments and team matches. Furthermore, I enjoy football, swimming, table tennis and swimming. I have an active and organised lifestyle that allows me to remain concentrated and productive at all times, albeit relaxed.

<p>My interest in finance and trading started when I first joined the Finance and Investment Societies and took part in numerous learning events that focused on concepts such as financial markets, institutions and their roles. In order to learn more, I started further reading Investopedia and undertaking online courses. I find myself intrigued by the fact that there is a line between risk and benefit, that can successfully be thinned by applying mathematical and statistical analysis with the scope of predicting favourable outcomes and, thus, minimising the risk and welcoming the benefits.</p>
