            </h2>
            <p>
              Ambitious and self-motivated Final Year Aeronautical Engineer studying at Imperial College London, gone rogue into the vast domain of Data Science and Machine Learning, with applications in Strategy Consulting and Finance. With experience in team-leading and currently working as a Data Analyst and Engineer, I am highly passionate about discovering and storytelling Data-driven insights that can help a company grow, all while developing a business and financial acumen and problem-solving abilities on the way.
            <p>
              I am a flexible person in the tech field, with extensive knowledge of Data Science programming languages (Python: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly, Scikit-learn | R: intermediate) and Machine Learning algorithms, such as Linear/Logistic Regressions, Naive Bayes, SVM, KNN and KMeans Clustering, which I am constantly using in my projects, as well as more advanced concepts like Feature Engineering, Random Forests/Bagging and Boosting techniques (XGBoost, AdaBoost). More than this, I have already dived head-on into Deep Learning, building two Computer Vision Object Detectors that use Convolutional Neural Networks, as well as my current focus on Recurrent Neural Networks and their invaluable use in time-series Forecasting (LSTM). Analysis-wise, I love to use powerful Data Visualization tools such as Tableau, PowerBI and SPSS to deliver and concisely present my data insights through 'storytelling'.
            <p>
              Therefore, I am currently building a Portofolio that focuses on applications of Data Science into the vast domains of Strategy Consulting and Finance, that can be found on Kaggle and below. All this said, I am always eager to improve both my personal and professional attributes while working in the vast and ever-growing data industry.
            <p>
              Apart from my academic interests, I currently practice tennis at a high level and take great pleasure in reading ancient or modern history books that describe past civilizations.

                    -&nbsp; Deployed a Python Machine Learning model that was trained on previous user inputs and accurately predicts if the CFD simulation is valid. Several ML classifiers were compared (KNN, Random Forest, Logistic Regression, XGBoost) and their hyperparameters were tuned with Panda's GridSearchCV and Pipeline. Analysing the required classification metrics and ROC curves, with an emphasis on reducing the rate of False Positive errors, the chosen classifier was a Random Forest that attained up to 93% testing accuracy. Finally, considering the large number of highly-correlated features (54), unsupervised PCA dimensionality reduction was performed and improved the model's accuracy by 1%. <br />
                    -&nbsp; Highly consolidated and exercised my Python, Linux
                    and SQL programming knowledge, with the aim of creating a

                  I have played tennis competitively for the past 10 years and I
                  am now currently part of the Imperial College Tennis Team. I
                  pratice tennis regularly: 3 times/ week, participating in
                  tournaments and team matches. Furthermore, I enjoy football,
                  swimming, table tennis and swimming. I have an active and
                  organised lifestyle that allows me to remain concentrated and
                  productive at all times, albeit relaxed.

                    My interest in the financial domain stems from my hobby of trading streetwear items, where I unconsciously discovered market concepts. Upon establishing a successful online trading business, in which I implemented both buy and sell sides, I delved deeper into markets, guided by Robert Shiller's Financial Markets course and the Bloomberg Market Concepts programme, and began applying concepts such as the volume-volatility relationship and multi-factor modeling as means to increase my initial investment. Moreover, as a self-taught data scientist and machine learning engineer, I have extensive Python/Matlab experience in multi-feature model-building, clustering models, stocks time-series visualizations and analysis (returns, moving averages, Bollinger bands) and NLP. Realising that my mathematics and computing skills go along with my passion for the financial industry and being fascinated by how these various data tools can be integrated into financial models, I took part in the UBS Quant Hackathon 2020 and completed two challenges: I built and back-tested a systematic stock-picking Portfolio (US Equities) in Python, optimizing it to outperform the S&P 500 Index, as well as I developed a Machine Learning Complex Pricing Model that efficiently predicts prices of equity-structured products faster than traditional models. Furthermore, I enrolled in the Finance and Investment Societies and took the Business School‚Äôs Financial Accounting module in order to  grasp a solid understanding of the financial industry.

                  Since my time in high-school, when I was participating in the National Physics Olympiads, my experiences were always motivated by a genuine curiosity of what it means to learn from data, in that case using experimental measurements and applying statistics to derive conclusions. This trend continued in university, where, during labs and report-writing, I found myself most comfortable working with large datasets that can be wrangled into tangible visualizations. Naturally, this lead me to start my journey of self-studying data science and machine learning, with applications in consulting, business and finance. Up to this day, I am constantly working on diverse Python/Matlab data projects, encompassing Deep Learning or multi-feature regressions and classifications (using both Bagging and Boosting algorithms), unsupervised models (K-Means Clustering, PCA), time-series analysis, NLP and Recommender Systems(CF), in which I try to formulate the hypothesis by asking myself challenging and innovative questions. Two projects that stand out are the development of a Computer Vision-Deep Learning algorithm that detects humans (up to 99\% confidence) and building entry points in real-time using novel Neural Network architectures and OpenCV, followed by my participation in the UBS Quant Hackathon, where I optimized a Python ML Complex Pricing tool (based on 156 features) that aims to overtake other commercial equity-pricing models.
